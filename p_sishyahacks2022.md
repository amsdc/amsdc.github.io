## About "Meteorite Shower"
**TL;DR** A simple retro video game involving colleting of articles and avoiding obstacles. Something like Chrome's T-Rex game in a vertical format.

The game was created in a two day cultural event (Sishya Hacks) at Sishyamrita - 2022. With zero knowledge of gaming development, the team learned fairly enough PyGame to create simple retro games. 

You may ask, why PyGame and not Unity, when the latter is more feature-rich? The reason is because the developers involved in this project were Pythonistas, and we couldn't learn C# + Unity in < 24 hours 

### Project Maintenance
As the developers are in a crucial academic year, they will not be devoting time to this project. However, they may consider improving it once that year is over.

## Playing the game
This is a game where the player (the green ball which we call bob) has to excape from the stones/meteors falling on him.

He needs to get points by collecting falling apples(i.e by standing below the apple),and get lives by collecting the falling hearts.

Bob has two basic movements, left and right which is accessible by left and right arrow keys respectively, that he needs to  use to excape from the falling stones.

Each game starts with 3 lives and a score of 0. 

The one with the highest score wins!

## Key Features
* Seperate sounds for getting hit by a stone, collecting apples and hearts
* Highscore counter that stores the highscore in a json file
* Retro Game menu
* Two differrent types of stones
