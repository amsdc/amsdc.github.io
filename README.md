# History

AMSDC has been making simple software solutions since 2016. The first product developed was Picture Viewer, a simple solution to view files. Coded in Visual Basic, the application featured several image-viewing capabilities. It was discontinued in 2018. 

## AMSDC Cloud
In 2020, the pandemic started and learning shifted online. Hence, there was a need for a simple, private, quick and reliable file uploading service. This led to the development of a personal cloud storage library, in PHP. A GUI front-end was created for the same. It was hosted in a HP 2000 laptop which ran Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. Later on, it was secured by a login system. This also led to the kickstart of few other projects, such as Fixed Links for Zoom Meetings. The website had to be taken down in January 2021 due to increasing running costs, and declining usage as schools started using Google Classroom by then.

## School Website
In 2021, Advaith created the school website. However, this was an independent undertaking, and not connected to AMSDC in any manner.
